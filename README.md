# Passenger Counter App

This is my take on Scrimba's exercise project for a **Passenger Counter**.  
The app is a simple and interactive tool to:

- Count the number of people.
- Remove people from the count.

## Features
- **Increment Counter**: Add to the current count of people.
- **Decrement Counter**: Subtract from the current count (within valid limits).
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive design.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For the structure of the app.
- **CSS**: For styling the app.
- **JavaScript**: For the logic and interactivity.

## How to Use
1. Open the app in your browser.
2. Click the **Increment** button to add people to the count.
3. Click the **Decrement** button to remove people from the count.
4. Enjoy the smooth functionality of the app!

This project is inspired by the **Scrimba** learning platform and serves as part of my practice in frontend development.
